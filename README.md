ðŸ’ Lately Data has grown , it has grown to be called BIG DATA !!! Now as we know this whole universe thing in which we live actuallly works in some kind of pattern, so every bt of data can be juiced out to get something from it. I love this work. It gives me a feeling of "Sherlock for data" ðŸ¤ ðŸ˜‚.

ðŸ’ So I love data, extracting insights from it and thus helping in making better data driven decisions.

ðŸ’ Although I have done Mechanical Engineering, In my 3rd year trading stocks grew my interests towards data. And over time, I learned something, my mind begged me to go more deeper, to be more clear in my observations.

ðŸ’ What I love about Data Science is its diversity , discovering different data and thus exploring the domains. Now i have learned so much from the community, it also my duty to give'em back, so I am here.

ðŸ’ In my repositories, you will find a lot of tuff related to statistics ( with Business cases) ,deep dive into ML algorthims , and much more.
